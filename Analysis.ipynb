    "\n",
    "* **Satisfaction Level (-0.35):** The strongest predictor in the dataset; as satisfaction decreases, turnover increases significantly.\n",
    "* **Time Spent at Company (0.22):** Increased tenure is positively correlated with leaving, indicating a higher risk of turnover among mid-to-senior level employees.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **2. Significant Workplace Interactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Number of Projects & Monthly Hours (0.34):** A strong link exists between project load and total work hours, identifying project volume as a primary driver of high workloads.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Score & Number of Projects (0.28):** Higher-performing employees are consistently assigned a greater number of projects.\n",
    "* **Evaluation Score & Monthly Hours (0.27):** High evaluation scores are strongly associated with increased monthly work hours, suggesting a \"performance tax\" on top talent.\n",
    "* **Tenure & Number of Projects (0.21):** Responsibilities and project counts tend to increase as an employee's time with the company grows.\n",
    "* **Satisfaction Level & Tenure (-0.18):** Longer-tenured employees tend to report lower satisfaction levels.\n",
    "* **Satisfaction Level & Number of Projects (-0.13):** An increase in project load is associated with a decrease in overall employee satisfaction.\n",
    "* **Tenure & Last Evaluation (0.12):** There is a slight positive trend where longer-tenured employees receive higher performance evaluations.\n",
    "* **Tenure & Monthly Hours (0.12):** Employee work hours tend to increase moderately alongside their years at the company.\n",

    "> After evaluating Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models, Random Forest emerged as the best-performing classifier with an ROC–AUC of 0.99 and a strong balance between precision and recall. Confusion-matrix analysis showed that it minimized both missed employee exits and unnecessary retention interventions. Feature-importance analysis confirmed that employee satisfaction, tenure, and workload are the primary drivers of turnover, aligning with exploratory data analysis findings."
